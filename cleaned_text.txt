in
grayish
mists
the
slimy
beasts
the
vokras
can
be
found
they
slowly
float
they
slowly
drift
above
the
sopping
ground
they
slowly
feed
on
rotten
weed
extending
limbs
to
earth
they
slowly
mate
they
slowly
breed
to
new
ones
giving
birth
they
slowly
decently
converse
of
happiness
and
vice
they
hunt
for
frogs
and
slide
them
in
the
buccal
orifice
in
grayish
mists
the
slimy
beasts
the
vokras
hunt
for
frogs
they're
worming
their
pliant
limbs
through
heaps
of
rotten
logs
away
from
people's
noisy
feasts
away
from
light
and
sound
in
grayish
mists
the
